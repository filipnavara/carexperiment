# Experiment with parsing .car asset catalog files

This experiment tries to parse the asset catalog files based on the information from [article by Alexandre Colluci](https://blog.timac.org/2018/1018-reverse-engineering-the-car-file-format/). In addition it tries to document the full format of the BOM files as used in the asset catalogs so they could be recreated by non-Apple tools.
